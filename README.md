## Introduction

This project focuses on the recipes and interaction datasets. The recipes dataset contains key information about recipe ingredients, tags, cooking steps, and nutrition, while the interaction dataset includes user reviews and ratings. The central question we are going to explore is: “Can we predict whether a recipe will be rated as healthy, normal, or bad based on its nutrition?” This question is important for promoting health-conscious choices, improving recipe recommendations, making it relevant to users alike.

## Hypothesis Testing

We conducted a hypothesis test to evaluate whether the mean protein content significantly differs between recipes categorized as "main-dish" and "appetizers." The null hypothesis posits that the difference in mean protein content between the two categories is due to random chance, while the alternative hypothesis states that the mean protein content for "main-dish" recipes is significantly higher than that of "appetizers." Using a permutation test with 10,000 iterations, we calculated the observed difference in means and compared it to the distribution of differences generated by shuffling category labels.
The results showed an observed difference of approximately 35.8, with a p-value of 0, indicating statistical significance. The histogram of permutation differences confirms that the observed difference lies far outside the null distribution. These results lead us to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that "main-dish" recipes have significantly higher protein content compared to "appetizers." This finding aligns with expectations, as main dishes are generally more protein-rich.
